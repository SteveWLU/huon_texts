                <note xml:id="b9915" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> The illumination at the bottom of this page is of a city with five towers visible, a figure in red (with head covering) at the top of the first gate on the left, nearest the three visitors who are at the far left. The gate figure holds a book with black dots to represent writing on it. Note that the tower is square, suggesting that "reont" refers to something else. <hi rend="ital">Charere</hi> (line 9915) means both "chair" (<hi rend="ital">cattedra</hi> in MSI) and "highway" in this text, as confirmed by other Franco-Italian texts. In fact, the gateway is rounded and the human figure is at the highest point. Since this is a scholar with a book, it makes the most sense for him to be in a chair or seat.  The portion remaining in the Turin MS (folio 146R) shows a loggia with rounded openings to the left of the illumination, with the three travellers outside to the left. One figure inside (with a fancy headdress) is on a chair with a baldacchino in a polygonal shape (not quite a circle, but circular) above. Since the walls in the Berlin MS illumination reach outside the frame, there is nothing above the figure who is on top of the gate there. It is unclear therefore whether the Turin version is a variation of meaning, but in any case, it is one possible explanation
                of <hi rend="ital">reont</hi>.</note>
                <note xml:id="b9935" type="refer" resp="#LZM"> There are several historical figures by the name Nicomachus to whom this may refer. Aristotle's father and son were both so named; the <title rend="ital">Nichomachean Ethics</title>, a compendium of Aristotle's notes (or Aristotle's notes plus Nichomachus's comments on them)  may have been dedicated to the son. Nicomachus of Gerasa, who lived in the first century AD, was a mathematician about whom little is known. His work on the magical properties of numbers and a manual on harmonics, an early discussion of musical theory and pitch. Various other works of his were lost. Since there are references to necromacy in this section, the second identity seems more likely.(Thanks to AEB for assistance in identifying the name.)</note>

                <note xml:id="b10329" type="interp" resp="#LZM">Tisiaus: Tisias is reported to have been the first theoretician of rhetoric in ancient Greece. It is taken that he was the student of one Corax, who has left no written work. Tradition has it that, after the fall of the monarchy in Sicily in the 5th c. BCE, the rise of democracy occasioned a need for persuasive speech (command no longer being accepted). One successful Sicilian practitioner was Gorgias who went to Athens in 427 BCE, where he became a major figure among the Sophists. In the <title rend="italic">Gorgias</title>, Plato accused rhetoricians of favoring opinion over truth, success in the moment over enduring verities. (See also <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title> 267a-b.) Thus, in the history of rhetoric, Tisias would stand in the same relationship to rhetoric as the Sophists to sophistry. Support for this view comes in the theory that Corax was not a separate person, but that the word, which means "crow" is actually a derogatory nickname for Tisias himself. Rhetoric received a higher standing with Aristotle, fascinated with how things break down into their component parts, who wrote
                his <title rend="italic">Rhetoric</title> as an analytical guide to, and practical manual for, the art—but he distinguished it from logic (dialectic).  In the later Middle Ages, therefore, Tisias may be taken as a mythical founder, an archetype for all who
                indulge in untruth for  emotional effect. Whatever his reputation in antiquity, in this passage, Berlin, lines 10324-10351, Tisias seems to represent all seven liberal arts (10328). The reference to his singing includes another of the seven: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. Wilfred Major, Epicharmus, Tisias, and the Early History of Rhetoric, <title rend="italic">Harvard Studies in Classical Philology</title> 107 (2013), 55-72; A. G. Hinks, "Tisias and Corax and the Invention of Rhetoric," <title rend="italic">The Classical Quarterly</title> 34,1/2 (Jan.-Apr., 1940), 61-69. (Alan E. Bernstein).</note>
                <note xml:id="b10335" type="interp" resp="#LZM"> This scene may refer to the beginning of the mass; at that era, the "introit involves the singing of a Psalm, which by this period would have been sung alternatingly by two choir bodies," and that might account for the "a bis" idea. Alternatively, it may be like improvisory practice where "one singer or group of singers would sing the original chant tune, and the other voices might improvise or sing composed counterpoint above it" and "vocal polyphony was used during mass, often with a low line carrying the chant tune, and upper voices providing countermelodies, improvised or otherwise." Where and when it was done and if the celebrant was involved would be difficult to verify since the specific origin of this story is not known. We thank Remi Chiu, Assoc.
