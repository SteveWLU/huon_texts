        <h1><hi rend="italic">Huon d'Auvergne</hi> Edition Criteria</h1>

        <h2><span>&#10081;</span> 1.1 General Considerations</h2>

    <p>In seeking to set criteria for our edition, we are faced with multiple concerns: not only are the languages of the witnesses on a scale between Old French and Italian (Vitale-Brovarone), but the editing traditions of the two types of texts are radically different. Franco-Italian itself, at midpoints between the two, has been represented in varying ways as well, depending upon the formation of the editor and the goals of the edition.</p>
  	<p>All editors seek "maximum fidelity to the original text," but this takes different forms. We will here pass in review the theoretical principles that have ruled in the French and Italian editing domains (note that these can be by non-French and non-Italian scholars, which also makes for differences) for the issues that concern us; we will then examine several Franco-Italian texts and how the editors put these into practice, followed by our own choices.</p>
    <p>In Old French Paul Meyer initially called for standards in 1910, followed by Roques in 1926 with specific instructions to use only the acute accent, and that only to designate the location of a stressed syllable when it is unclear for a modern [French] reader and to distinguish between monosyllables where there could be multiple meanings. Marking dieresis also follows very fixed rules which we will here omit since the counting of poetic syllables is generally hazy in Franco-Italian (see below, on use of dieresis). Other aspects, perhaps immediately clear to a French speaker, Foulet and Speer spell out in 1979: the use of the apostrophe as in Modern French to separate articles and pronouns, to mark the elided vowel of the possessive adjective and composite verbs, and for enclitic and proclitic agglutinations. They also note that in accenting monosyllables, one uses the accent on one-syllable nouns and adjectives in the oblique case singular and subject case plural, and on –e or –ie followed by an –s, no other consonants. (Again, we omit the explicit rules on dieresis.) They further offer advice on compound consonants: if there is any doubt about meaning, eliminate one! Speer and Foulet furthermore note that modern-style quotation marks are helpful, though not advised by French editors, and that one should only correct obvious errors, mentioning scribal corrections in notes or with variants. They counsel replacing bourdons with appropriate text from another manuscript (80). As far as word division, they find no issue in writing compound prepositions and adverbs either as one word or two, as long as the editor is consistent (61). Square brackets are used for missing material added, either resolution of abbreviations or editorial addition. Lepage, in addition, advises adding the cedilla to a c as in Modern French, and to capitalize all roman numerals. He does note, "chaque texte est un cas d'espèce requérant une approche particulière" (Guide p. 9). The ENC counsels apostrophes according to modern usage, with the exception of OF enclisis, which should be written jel, al, del, etc. However, in manuscripts that use enclisis a lot, one can use the raised dot as in Occitan (46). They counsel writing together only words that came together in modern usage. They also re-emphasize to avoid entirely circumflex or grave accents, and they address the possibility of using an inverted caret in-line to designate additions above or below the line. They add that as far as the apparatus, "ce qui est pris dans les manuscrits est en romain, tout le reste, sigles de manuscrits et explication de la nature de la variante, est en italique" and repeat that there is no punctuation in the variants. They too modernize the c with cedilla to modern usage and use the "point en haut" for enclisis, which is not noted for combinations of preposition and definite article forms also occuring in OF frequently (vol. 1, p. 46). They note, furthermore, that literary texts generally do not indicate what is abridged and restituted, i.e., the resolution of abbreviations (vol. 3, p. 61), but in texts important for the history of the language or the paleographer, it could be necessary (vol. 1, 31); "la transposition du système du ou des témoins (à plus forte raison s'il y a plusieurs témoins) dans notre propre système est indispensable pour que le lecteur contemporain puisse percevoir aisément le texte" (fasc. III, p. 29).</p>
    <p>In Old Italian, Florentine is frequently the standard by which principles are created. Brambilla Ageno's 1975 principles begin modern critical editing. Her volume, however, speaks of the entire process, not concentrating on the nitty-gritty of accents. She notes the use of the raised dot to designate syntactic doubling, with a dash for "raddoppiamento casuale" of the final –n; example: "pregò∙llo [...] inn-altra" (127). She notes, however, "Per i testi settentrionali (e per i testi in lingua ibrida, di fondo settentrionale con patina toscaneggiate), [...] vanno sempre rispettati gli scempiamenti consonantici, che non sono neppure un'abitudine grafica, ma corrispondono alla reale pronuncia" (p. 128). To clarify standard editing practice for medieval Italian texts, in addition to Brambilla Ageno's manual we consulted Fassò (1981); Donadello (1994); Furlati (2003); Allaire (2002), Psaki (2006), and Bénéteau (2012), including both Italian and foreign editorial practitioners and an arc of production. This last is important, because with the advent of personal computers, some editorial conventions have changed; thus, for example, the early twentieth-century use of square brackets to designate resolution of abbreviations has changed to italics since these are easily accessible by the individual editor at home.</p>
    <p>Editors of medieval Italian texts alter the textual appearance significantly more than those of medieval French texts. Normal is reducing cha, and chu, gha, gho, ghu to forms without the h as in Modern Italian, and similarly cie, gie, scie to ce, ge, sce (cf. Furlati, p. 58-59; Bénéteau, p. 61; Fassò, p. CXXIX); changing ngn, lgl to gn and gl, as per modern spelling (Ageno ; Furlati, p. 59; Bénéteau, p. 61; Fassò, p. CXXIX); adding accents and apostrophes (Furlati, p. 60); the use of the q vs. c is standardized (Ageno, p. 123; Furlati, p. 59; Bénéteau, p. 61; Fassò, p. CXXIX). The nasal before labial is frequently standardized from n to m (Bénéteau, p. 61; Fassò, p. CXXIX). An h is added in exclamations: ah, oh, deh, ahi (Furlati, Bénéteau, Fassò). Consonant doubling is edited (Ageno, p. 124; Bénéteau, p. 62). As far as diacritics go, a circumflex indicates the loss of a syllable (Ageno, p. ; Furlati, p. 60). The use of the raised dot, however, varies (a∙rre for assimilation of the article, Furlati, p. 61, Fassò, p. CXXXII; Bénéteau: no∙e for the loss of a consonant to assimilation, p. 62), and the union of two words in adverbial and prepositional expressions also varies from editor to editor. Other interventions vary with the intentions and audience of the edition; Fassò, for example, seeks to restore rhyme and meter (CXXI).</p>
    <p>Editors of Franco-Italian texts have responded to these differences and the varying needs of their texts with different solutions. Among the recent editions examined are Wunderli's Aquilon de Bavière (1982); Holtus's Aliscans (1985); Beretta's Chanson de Roland IV (1995); Duggan's Chanson de Roland V7-Chateauroux (2005); Cook's Chanson de Roland V4 (2005), as well as reviews of those editions, together with the editions appearing on RIALFrI of various Franco-Italian texts of different genres. Due to interest in language and the fact of frequently single manuscripts for a given text, the conventions are conservative, yet vary by the inclinations of the editor's critical school. Holtus, in his almost universally well-regarded edition, uses the acute accent as in French tradition together with certain Italian conventions (to distinguish between monosyllables, p. XXIV). He includes dieresis for metrical reasons (p. XXVI), rarely adds cedilla to c among the palatal consonants (XXVIII) and uses the raised dot for enclitic pronouns before a consonant (de∙l honorer) and for cases of assimilation (no∙l oncie) but not for articles (pp. XXVIII-XXIX). The text of Aliscans is very much to the French end of the spectrum, and therefore is useful for the Berlin MS. Aquilon, on the other hand, is in prose, and at the late end of the chronological spectrum. Wunderli does not edit the palatals (c to ç); uses the acute accent according to Old French standards on final –e (p. XLIX), but also to distinguish between certain words, not just monosyllables (p. L). He does not use dieresis, as this is a prose text and thus syllabification is not necessary for metrical reasons. He uses the raised dot for an enclitic particle that produces apocope, syncope or elision, be those pronouns or articles (e∙l don; je∙l, no∙l), and simplifies initial doubled consonants: delluy > de luy (p. LI). He also normalizes the presentation of numbers, adding dots for those missing around roman numerals, and giving all as lower case.</p>
	<p>Beretta precedes his edition of V4 with a reasoned explanation of his procedures, first for resolution of abbreviations, usually related to frequency of complete forms in the text (exception made for titulus, which is resolved according to modern forms). His use of accents, both acute and grave, and the apostrophe, partake of French and Italian traditions. He seeks to render clear which syllable is accented by providing guidance on polysyllabic words, for example (e.g. pèrdere, p. XXVII), and also to distinguish between homographs, thus e, è, é, e'  for, respectively, for reflexes of Latin ET, EST, ECCE EGO/ES. He uses the raised dot to signal enclisis (e.g. v'à∙l dit, line 399; e∙l fer, line 1577; te∙l vende, line 1587, so for both article and pronoun, preceding and following the verb). The dash serves to unite a word to an enclitic particle that has kept its syllabic value (e.g., volez-me, line 4912); he also uses dieresis where diphthongues appear, except in rhyme where he uses a grave accent (veù, p. XXXI). Interesting is the use of bold for resolution of abbreviations.</p>
    <p>The texts of the Chanson de Roland, a classic in French tradition, are so important as to have aroused quite an interest and many editions over the years. V4 in particular has been frequently edited; another recent edition, by Cook, takes a different approach, more closely following the French tradition. He seeks to offer, through a "lighter editorial touch [...] an experience of the text that is closer to that of the medieval reader, who had none of the apparatus" (p. II/65). He notes that the system used by Beretta "may be daunting to many readers" (II/64). He also notes that use of the apostrophe "implies that something normal or expected is not written," due to "scribal intent gone wrong or thanks to a regular substitution" (II/73). He applies dieresis according to French conventions (II/75), and follows the Roland collection in which the edition is published for accentuation according to French norms where possible. He does not therefore distinguish homonyms except for a few cases of nouns and verb forms (II/76-77). He avoids marking enclisis of articles and pronouns (nel, sel, etc.) and uses the apostrophe for proclisis of articles and pronouns (II/80). This edition, together with Duggan's in the same collection, are helpful in considering (polite) responses to alternative editing criteria.</p>
	<p>The texts of Huon d'Auvergne vary from 1341 to 1441, and the language in them varies from close to Old French to close to regional Italians. We have therefore decided, using the best of traditions from each side, to offer certain elements in common, and others according to the tradition nearer to each version, while annotating those elements that might cause confusion. As Cook says eloquently says, "To approach the V4 Roland as either an 'Italian' or a 'French' work is misleading; it is by nature polyvalent" (II/70). Like the Roland, Huon is fortunate in having multiple versions which can possibly be used to clarify lacunae or bourdons, and also in partaking of "ambiguity, since they use the same signs (including abbreviations) for different purposes" (II/70). Thus, first we offer the elements in common, then a section on each manuscript, including criteria for edition that includes decisions related to the individual manuscript that includes word division, use of diacritics, abbreviations and their resolutions, and finally any special considerations for that particular manuscript.</p>

    <h2>&#10081; 2.1 Specific Criteria of Edition</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Capitalization of proper names (persons and places); capitalization of nominalized adjectives referring to place of origin, as well as adjectives (common to French and English usage, but not Italian, this here facilitates comprehension. Furthermore, capitalization of nomina sacra and metaphors referring to them: God, the Virgin, Father, etc. (Cf. Furlati, p. 61: Dio onipotente; Wunderli, p. XLIX).</li>
        <li>Punctuation is added to divide units of meaning and to mark quotations.</li>
        <li>Resolution of abbreviations according to the most frequent normal form, where there is one, or according to rhyme, where relevant. A list of abbreviations accompanies each manuscript description, together with the resolutions used. In Berlin, Padua, and Bologna, these are italicized; in Turin, they appear in square brackets [ ] since Rajna's transcription of Turin that completes the now-damaged text appears in italics.</li>
        <li>Latin quotes appear in bold. This permits them to be similarly designated across all texts.</li>
        <li>Roman numerals are in small capitals ; standard usage calls for capitals in French (e.g., CETM 15b, p. 29) in order to distinguish them from surrounding text. In our texts they are generally miniscules between periods (occasionally missing). We follow the French standard in using small capitals, as do other editors of Franco-Italian texts (cf. Beretta, Holtus). In Turin, both roman and arabic numbers appear; again we use small capitals to distinguish roman numerals.</li>
        <li>We distinguish i and j, u and v, according to modern standard languages where such equivalents exist. The final "j" of roman numerals is given as "i" as per editing standards in both languages (Brambilla Ageno et al.).
        Word division and diacritical use are discussed individually for each manuscript.</li>
